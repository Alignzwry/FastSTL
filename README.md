# FastSTL

**FastSTL** is a collection of optimized C++ headers, reimplementing and enhancing standard library containers and algorithms to achieve better performance in performance-critical applications. Each header in FastSTL is designed to replace its standard library counterpart with an emphasis on speed, memory efficiency, and improved functionality where possible.

## Overview

The goal of **FastSTL** is to provide high-performance alternatives to commonly used C++ containers and utilities, such as `std::vector`, `std::map`, and more. FastSTL focuses on:
- **Efficiency**: Reducing overhead and optimizing common operations.
- **Flexibility**: Offering additional options for configuration and fine-tuning.
- **Compatibility**: Maintaining an interface similar to the C++ standard library for easy integration.

> **Note:** Each header file includes a detailed list of pros and cons to help users determine if the FastSTL version fits their use case.

## Installation

To use FastSTL, simply clone this repository and include the headers you need in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FastSTL.git
```

Include FastSTL headers in your project as you would with standard library headers:
```cpp
#include "FastSTL/vector.hpp"
#include "FastSTL/map.hpp"
```

## Usage

FastSTL headers can be used as direct replacements for their standard library counterparts. For example:

```cpp
#include "FastSTL/vector.hpp"

int main() {
    FastSTL::vector<int> myVector;
    myVector.push_back(10);
    // Use as you would with std::vector
}
```

## Available Headers

### `FastSTL/vector.hpp`
An optimized version of `std::vector` with faster allocation strategies and improved performance on certain operations.

- **Pros**:
  - Reduced allocation overhead for frequent push/pop operations.
  - Optional parameters for more granular memory management.

- **Cons**:
  - May have slightly larger memory usage than `std::vector` for small datasets.
  - Potentially slower compile times due to additional template complexity.

---

### `FastSTL/map.hpp`
An alternative to `std::map` designed with optimized insertion and retrieval times.

- **Pros**:
  - Faster insertion for large datasets.
  - Customizable comparison and hashing options for advanced use cases.

- **Cons**:
  - May not support all `std::map` features in the initial release.
  - Larger binary size due to additional optimizations.

---

### `FastSTL/algorithm.hpp`
Improved versions of selected standard library algorithms with a focus on reducing complexity and improving runtime for large inputs.

- **Pros**:
  - More efficient sorting and searching algorithms for specific data types.
  - Additional options for parallel processing (requires C++17 or higher).

- **Cons**:
  - Parallel algorithms may increase memory usage.
  - Limited to specific data types and conditions for some optimizations.
